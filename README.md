[Kaggle Python Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/58301)

Description from Kaggle:

Python was recently called the fastest growing major programming language by StackOverflow, and itâ€™s especially influential in data science. 5 out of 6 of our tracks on Kaggle Learn use Python. Whether itâ€™s data manipulation with Pandas, creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, or deep learning with TensorFlow, Python seems to have a tool for everything.

But what if you missed the Python train? Itâ€™s never too late to start! Our next challenge will take you from 0 to Pythonic in 7 days. Weâ€™ll be covering the foundational Python skills that youâ€™ll need before jumping in to using it for data science: defining functions, booleans and conditionals, lists and slicing, and much more. Already have some Python experience? Join us for a refresher. Each dayâ€™s exercises will include at least one optional, ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶extra-spicyðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ problem that may challenge even experienced Python coders.
