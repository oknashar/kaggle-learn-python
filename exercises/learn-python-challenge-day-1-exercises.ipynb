    "You may have noticed a few problems (with accompanying warning messages printed out):\n",
    "\n",
    "- We wanted each image to be drawn in a square (with width and height of 2 inches), but they're being drawn inside fat rectangles.\n",
    "- Our grid can only fit at most 15 images. If we sample more than that, only the first 15 are shown.\n",
    "- If we sample a small number of images, we waste a lot of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these problems stem from our shoddy approach to step 2 in the code. Instead of using the same grid dimensions every time, they should adapt to the number of images we're showing. For example, if `n = 3`,  we should make a 6\" x 2\" grid with 1 row and 3 columns. If `n = 15`, we should make a 16\" x 4\" grid with 2 rows and 8 columns. (We'll have one empty space in the grid, but that's okay, as long as we don't have whole rows or columns that are empty.)\n",

    "<small>**Note**: I'm intentionally glossing over the details of steps 1, 3, and 4 of the code. If you're curious about how the functions we imported such as `sample_images_of_category`, or `draw_images_on_subplots` work, you can check out their definitions [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/learntools/blob/master/learntools/python/quickdraw.py). The code uses lots of syntax and data structures that we'll cover later, so if it looks like gibberish to you at this point, don't worry. We will *not* be going into the specifics of data visualization using matplotlib or any other library in this course. But fortunately, we have a [track on Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualisation) on just that topic.</small>"
